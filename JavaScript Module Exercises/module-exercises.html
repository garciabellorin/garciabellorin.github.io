    <h2>2. Define Global Scope and Local Scope in Javascript.</h2>
    <p>Global Scope are those elements declared outside a function or code block, and they
        are not limited to any code block. They belong to the outermost closure, and can be accessible
        anywhere globally outside any function of method in our script.
    </p>
    <p>
        Local scope refers to those elements declared within a function or code block. It also depends
        if those variables are declared as <em><strong>let</strong></em> or <em><strong>const</strong></em>,
        their scope is locally limited to the code block or function in which they were defined. Those elements
        are not accessible outside of the code block or function in which they were defined.
    </p>
    <h2>3. Consider the following structure of Javascript code:</h2>
    <pre>
    // Scope A
    function XFunc () {
        // Scope B
        function YFunc () {
            // Scope C
        };
    };
</pre>
    <h2>(a) Do statements in Scope A have access to variables defined in Scope B and C?</h2>
    <p>No.</p>
    <h2>(b) Do statements in Scope B have access to variables defined in Scope A?</h2>
    <p>Yes.</p>
    <h2>(c) Do statements in Scope B have access to variables defined in Scope C?</h2>
    <p>No.</p>
    <h2>(d) Do statements in Scope C have access to variables defined in Scope A?</h2>
    <p>Yes.</p>
    <h2>(e) Do statements in Scope C have access to variables defined in Scope B?</h2>
    <p>Yes.</p>
