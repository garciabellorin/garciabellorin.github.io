    <h2>2. Define Global Scope and Local Scope in Javascript.</h2>
    <p>Global Scope are those elements declared outside a function or code block, and they
        are not limited to any code block. They belong to the outermost closure, and can be accessible
        anywhere globally outside any function of method in our script.
    </p>
    <p>
        Local scope refers to those elements declared within a function or code block. It also depends
        if those variables are declared as <em><strong>let</strong></em> or <em><strong>const</strong></em>,
        their scope is locally limited to the code block or function in which they were defined. Those elements
        are not accessible outside of the code block or function in which they were defined.
    </p>
    <h2>3. Consider the following structure of Javascript code:</h2>
    <pre>
    // Scope A
    function XFunc () {
        // Scope B
        function YFunc () {
            // Scope C
        };
    };
</pre>
    <h2>(a) Do statements in Scope A have access to variables defined in Scope B and C?</h2>
    <p>No.</p>
    <h2>(b) Do statements in Scope B have access to variables defined in Scope A?</h2>
    <p>Yes.</p>
    <h2>(c) Do statements in Scope B have access to variables defined in Scope C?</h2>
    <p>No.</p>
    <h2>(d) Do statements in Scope C have access to variables defined in Scope A?</h2>
    <p>Yes.</p>
    <h2>(e) Do statements in Scope C have access to variables defined in Scope B?</h2>
    <p>Yes.</p>
    
    <h2>
        4. What will be printed by the following (answer without running it)?
    </h2>
    <pre>var x = 9;
function myFunction() {
    return x * x;
    }
    document.write(myFunction()); <span class="comments">//previously displayed: (blank) -> currently displayed: 81</span>
    x = 5;
    document.write(myFunction()); <span class="comments">//previously displayed: 81 -> currently displayed: 8125</span></pre>
    <span class="answer">Answer: 8125</span>

<h2>5. What will the alert print out? (Answer without running the code. Remember ‘hoisting’.)?</h2>

<pre>var foo = 1;
function bar() {
    if (!foo) { <span class="comments">//Predicate is true because of the declaration of foo outside of the function body</span>
        var foo = 10; <span class="comments">//current value of foo</span>
    }
    alert(foo); <span class="comments">//output is alert(10)</span>
}
bar();
</pre>
<span class="answer">Answer: is an alert(10)</span>

<h2>6. Consider the following definition of an add( ) function to increment a counter variable:</h2>

<pre>var add = (function () {
    var counter = 0;
    return function () {
        return counter += 1;
    }
})();</pre>
<h2>Modify the above module to define a count object with two methods: add( ) and reset( ). The count.add( ) method
    adds one to the counter (as above). The count.reset( ) method sets the counter to 0</h2>
