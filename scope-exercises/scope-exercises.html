    <h2>2. What is the difference between a method and function?</h2>
    <p>The main difference is that functions are a set of methods that perform a task whereas a method
        is a function assigned to an object property. Functions can be used directly while methods can
        be called only by the object that contains them.</p>
<p>For example, if we have a function to calculate area</p>
<pre>var rectangle = function area (sideA, sideB) {
    var sum = sideA * sideB;
    return sum;
};
</pre>
<p>We can use area function as a standalone object because it is not associated with any other object, 
    just the required parameters. For example, <em>rectangle(2, 4); // 8</em></p>
    <p>However, if we have a simple object like a string (<em>var str = 'TWO WORDS'</em>)  and we want to use
    the method <em>toLowerCase()</em>, we have to associate it with the given string, otherwise it does not 
    have any sense <em>var lowCase = str.toLowerCase(); // 'two words'</em> since <em>toLowerCase()</em>is
a method of <em>String</em> object.</p>

    <h2>3. What does 'this' refer to when used in a Java method?</h2>
    <p>In Java, <em><strong>this</strong></em> refers to the instance variables of a class, disregarding the 
        method from what this variable is called.</p>
    <h2>4. What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript method?</h2>
    <p>In JavaScript, <em><strong>this</strong></em> refers to the variables of the object owner when a method is called. 
        However, the method itself can have its own variables and, at the same time, every inner object 
        can have its own variables to which they also refer with a <em><strong>this</strong></em> keyword.</p>
    <h2>5. What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript constructor function?</h2>
    <p>Refers to the parameters of a function constructor. Initially, <em><strong>this</strong></em> does not have a value
         but it is used to pass the parameters references to the object variables, similar to Java. Later, the object 
         itself uses them.</p>
    <h2>
        6. Assume object x is the prototype for object y in Javascript. Object x has
        a method f( ) containing keyword 'this'. When f is called by x.f( ),
        what does 'this' refer to?
    </h2>
    <p>Refers to x</p>
    <h2>7. What is a free variable in JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>Free variables are variables that are neither locally declared nor passed as parameter. They are outside of
        the closure. However, a free variable for one method might not be a free variable for an outer method.</p>
    <h2>
        8. Create an object that has properties with name = "fred" and major="music" and a property that is a function
        that takes 2 numbers and returns the smallest of the two, or the square of the two if they are equal.
    </h2>
    <pre>var equalsOrNot = {
    "name": "fred",
    "major": "music",
    "smallOrSquare": function(a, b) {
        if (a === b) {
            return ((a * a) + (b * b));
        }
        else {
            return (a > b ? b : a);
        }
    }
}</pre>
    <h2>
        9. Write Javascript code for creating three Employee objects using the "new" keyword and a constructor function.
        Employee objects have the following fields: name, salary, position.
    </h2>
    <pre>function employee(name, salary, position) {
    this.name = name;
    this.salary = salary;
    this.position = position;
    }
    var johnMalkovich = new employee("John Malkovich", 96000, "Program Manager");
    var sandraBullock = new employee("Ken Jones", 106000, "Testing Engineer");
    var susanSarandon = new employee("Afework Fita", 101000, "Software Developer");</pre>
    <h2>
        10. Write a Javascript function that takes any number of input arguments and returns the product of the
        arguments.
    </h2>
    <pre>function aFunction (...numbers) {
    var product;
    for (let i = 0; i &lt; numbers.length; i++) {
        product *= numbers[i];
    }
    return product;
}</pre>
    <h2>11. Write an arrow function that returns the maximum of its three input arguments.</h2>
    <pre>var returnMax = (a, b, c) => {
    var max;
    max = (a &gt; b) ? a : b;
    max = (max &gt; c) ? max : c;
    return max;
};</pre>
